What is a gene? In this little program, a gene is a linear array of real numbers - that gene is then interpreted in various ways to create images on the screen. By selecting an image, you are choosing that gene to be the source of eight new clones. Each clone is a variation of the parent. Slight variations over time lead to significant changes.

Minimalist UX:

- keys 'a' through 'd' select different classes of genes with different rendering styles
- the space key (' ') will randomize the gene contents and length
- clicking on a cell will select that gene as the parent of the next generation

Notes:

You will need a recent version of [Processing](http://processing.org) installed in order to run this application.
